			<h1>What is Travelers' Philanthropy?</h1>
			<p>All over the world, travelers and travel companies are giving financial resources, time, and talent to
				further the well-being of local communities. This emerging movement is helping to support and empower
				local and indigenous communities by providing jobs, skills, and lasting improvements in health care,
				education, and environmental stewardship. To provide a portal for travelers to make a difference at
				their destinations, we created Travelersâ€™ Philanthropy, a quick and easy place to learn about and
				donate to development projects at home and abroad.</p>
			<p>We have brought together a group of superb tourism companies dedicated to local communities and the
				environment. On our Community Projects page, you can see the community efforts they support, and make
				secure donations with a single click. There, you can also learn about pioneering companies who have
				long been front-runners in the movement for worldwide philanthropic giving.</p>
